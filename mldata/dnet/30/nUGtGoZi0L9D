Details Of College Project : 

Project name: Fingerprint Verification

	With the advent of electronic banking, security of information stored
in various database is become important. To control unauthorized access
to that information there is strong need of identification is based on
unique characteristics. Compare to PIN & Password, biometric solution is
more reliable. Among all biometric fingerprint based identification is
one of the most mature and proven technique. Fingerprint is the users
own physical property which cannot be stolen or misplaced.

 We developed the most general and simpler approach for fingerprint
verification which basically operates in two stages minutiae extraction
and minutiae matching. Various algorithms have been developed for this
purpose .Among them minutiae based approach is most popular and easier.

 Also this method reduces whole image into some points patterns, hence
matching is also become easy. To achieve this, we develop software for
preprocessing, feature extraction and verification of fingerprint using
Visual Basics & image processing techniques (part of our subject D.S.P.)

Duration of Project: Six months
