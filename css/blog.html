    <h1>The Seven Components Of Self-Defense</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>There are seven essential categories to<br> a comprehensive approach to personal safety.
    If you know what they are, you can evaluate your <br>“mental map” about self-defense and determine what you know, 
    where<br> the gaps are and what you need to learn more about.</p>
    </article><br><br>  
    
    
    
    
    <h2>Component #1 – Self-Defense Training</h2>
    <p>In my opinion, a commitment to ongoing self-defense and combat-<br>
      related workouts is an integral part of a realistic approach to self-defense<br>
      and achieving optimal health and safety.</p>
    <p>The doctrine of Toughen Up addresses self-defense training and has three ingredients.<p>
    <ol>
      <li>Combative Drills as a form of exercise</li>
      <li>Functional Exercise to improve combative performance</li>
      <li>Strategies to help you “Toughen Up” physically, mentally and emotionally.</li>
    </ol>
     <p>I believe that ongoing training is the ONLY realistic way to fully align yourself with those principles.<br>
       
       
       
       
      <h2>Component #2 – Self-Defense Intelligence</h2>
    <p>Your brain is your most powerful weapon.<br> Self-Defense Intelligence is the development of awareness, situational assessment,<br> threat recognition and desion-making.
      <br>
      <p>Intelligence includes “street survival” concepts and formulas, <br>similar to those used in law enforcement and the military, <br>that help you to focus and structure your awareness and thinking during a critical incident.<br>
      <p>The more accurate and realistic your knowledge is about violence and confrontation,<br> the more effective you will be at detecting,<br> recognizing and resolving threatening situations.<br>
        
    <h2>Component #3 – Self-Defense Response Strategies</h2>
    <p>No two self-defense situations are the same. <br>Each brings with it variables and factors that make it unique and unpredictable. <br>What might work in one situation could backfire and make things worse in another.<br>
    <p><br>You need a range of response strategies and the ability to apply the strategy with the highest probability of success.<br>
    <p>When you get right down to it, there are five strategies to deal with <br>a volatile situation: compliance, <br>escape, de-escalation, defiance and fighting. <br>Knowing when to implement your “best bet” strategy,<br> when to abandon one that’s not working,<br> or how to combine them are important skills to acquire.<br>
    
    <h2>Component #4 – Prevention</h2>
    <p>Prevention tips are precautionary actions that reduce the likelihood of falling victim to a violent, <br>criminal or predatory situation.<br>
    <p>If you understand the brain’s predisposition for complacency, <br>you should know that you can’t just apply safety tactics<br>when you think you need them.<br> Bad things happen when you least expect them.<br>
