    <h1>The Seven Components Of Self-Defense</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>There are seven essential categories to<br> a comprehensive approach to personal safety.
    If you know what they are, you can evaluate your <br>“mental map” about self-defense and determine what you know, 
    where<br> the gaps are and what you need to learn more about.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <h2>Component #1 – Self-Defense Training</h2>
    <p>In my opinion, a commitment to ongoing self-defense and combat-<br>
      related workouts is an integral part of a realistic approach to self-defense<br>
      and achieving optimal health and safety.</p>
    <p>The doctrine of Toughen Up addresses self-defense training and has three ingredients.<p>
    <ol>
      <li>Combative Drills as a form of exercise</li>
      <li>Functional Exercise to improve combative performance</li>
      <li>Strategies to help you “Toughen Up” physically, mentally and emotionally.</li>
    </ol>
     <p>I believe that ongoing training is the ONLY realistic way to fully align yourself with those principles.<br>
       
       
       
       
      <h2>Component #2 – Self-Defense Intelligence</h2>
    <p>Your brain is your most powerful weapon.<br> Self-Defense Intelligence is the development of awareness, situational assessment,<br> threat recognition and desion-making.
      <br>
      <p>Intelligence includes “street survival” concepts and formulas, <br>similar to those used in law enforcement and the military, <br>that help you to focus and structure your awareness and thinking during a critical incident.<br>
      <p>The more accurate and realistic your knowledge is about violence and confrontation,<br> the more effective you will be at detecting,<br> recognizing and resolving threatening situations.<br>
        
    <h2>Component #3 – Self-Defense Response Strategies</h2>
    <p>No two self-defense situations are the same. <br>Each brings with it variables and factors that make it unique and unpredictable. <br>What might work in one situation could backfire and make things worse in another.<br>
    <p><br>You need a range of response strategies and the ability to apply the strategy with the highest probability of success.<br>
    <p>When you get right down to it, there are five strategies to deal with <br>a volatile situation: compliance, <br>escape, de-escalation, defiance and fighting. <br>Knowing when to implement your “best bet” strategy,<br> when to abandon one that’s not working,<br> or how to combine them are important skills to acquire.<br>
    
    <h2>Component #4 – Prevention</h2>
    <p>Prevention tips are precautionary actions that reduce the likelihood of falling victim to a violent, <br>criminal or predatory situation.<br>
    <p>If you understand the brain’s predisposition for complacency, <br>you should know that you can’t just apply safety tactics<br>when you think you need them.<br> Bad things happen when you least expect them.<br>
    <p>At some point, you need to evaluate your lifestyle and determine the right balance between being safe and living your life.
    <p>There are virtually hundreds of things that you can do to improve your personal safety. <br>Some are simple, some take some effort and some just aren’t realistic or practical. <br>If you understand the fundamentals of prevention, you can improvise and adopt the ones that make sense to you, <br>your family and your current circumstance<br>
    
      
      
    <h2>Component #5 – Predatory Recognition</h2>
    <p>If you could consistently recognize a criminal, rapist, mugger or bully how much safer would you be?
     <p>Unfortunately, most violent or predatory people don’t look much different from anyone else. <br>Your ability to detect and recognized cues and indicators associated to someone who is in the process of setting <br>you up as their “next&nbsp;victim” is crucial to protecting yourself.<br>
    <p>The more you know about the motives, methods and behavior of a predator, <br>the better you can steer clear of, preempt or respond to a violent situation.<br>
    
    
    
    
    <h2>Component #6 – Victim Selection</h2>
    <p>Not everyone will become the victim of a violent crime. In fact, for every person who is victimized, <br>dozens are evaluated and passed over.  By understanding first that there is a selection process, and secondly what the criteria <br>of a “desirable target” are, you can reduce the probability of being selected as a potential victim.<br>
    <p>Research into that selection process reveals that human predators, whether they’re aware they’re doing it or not,<br> select a victim based on their perception of how vulnerable they are and whether that person is ready, <br>willing and able fight back.<br>
    <p>The way you move, carry yourself and behave impacts your “victim profile.”<br> By taking charge of those criteria,<br> you can reduce the probability of being selected as a potential victim. <br>

    <h2>Component #7 – Survival Psychology</h2>
    <p>Millions of years of evolution have “wired” us for survival. <br>The need to feel safe and secure is deeply ingrained in all of us. <br>Many psychologists consider the fear of interpersonal violence to be a <q>Universal&nbsp;Human&nbsp;Phobia.</q><br>
     <p>The thought of being victimized is unsettling to most people.<br> Some people block it out of their minds and become complacent, others worry about it more than they should and there are those, like yourself, <br>who accept it as a reality of the way the world works and do something about it.<br>
    <p>Unmanaged fear or a sense of helplessness can erode our health and the quality of our lives. <br>Being safety-conscious does not mean being fearful or paranoid. Quite the contrary, <br>self-defense knowledge and skills provides a sense of control and resilience.<br>
    <p>Survival Psychology develops the mind in areas such as responsibility, motivation, confidence and mental toughness.<br>
