    <h1>The Seven Components Of Self-Defense</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>There are seven essential categories to<br> a comprehensive approach to personal safety.
    If you know what they are, you can evaluate your <br>“mental map” about self-defense and determine what you know, 
    where<br> the gaps are and what you need to learn more about.</p>
    </article><br><br>
    <h2>Component #1 – Self-Defense Training</h2>
    <p>In my opinion, a commitment to ongoing self-defense and combat-<br>
      related workouts is an integral part of a realistic approach to self-defense<br>
      and achieving optimal health and safety.</p>
    <p>The doctrine of Toughen Up addresses self-defense training and has three ingredients.<p>
    <ol>
      <li>Combative Drills as a form of exercise<li>
      <li>Functional Exercise to improve combative performance</li>
      <li>Strategies to help you “Toughen Up” physically, mentally and emotionally.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In a previous post,  I wrote about four principles of self-defense training:
       Self-Defense = Health, Adopting A Training Focus, The Erosion Effect and 
       The Performance Equation.
