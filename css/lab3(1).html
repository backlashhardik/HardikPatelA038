  <h1>Cascade of CSS Example</h1>
  <h2>Subheading 1</h2>
  <p>Inheritence allows us to write more global styles on parent elements and then "fine-tune" the styles for some of the child elements as needed. Such approach makes writing CSS very efficient.</p>
  <h2 style="color: green;">Subheading 2</h2>
  <p> Inheritance is a mechanism that's separate from the cascade: inheritance applies to the DOM (Document Object Model) tree, while the cascade deals with the style sheet rules. However, CSS properties set on an element via the cascade can beinherited by that element's child elements.
